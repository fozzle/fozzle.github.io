What is this garbage?
=====================

So my senior year of college I was taking this really cool sci-fi literature class as a free elective. For our final project we could either write analysis of an existing scifi work or create our own. Being the doofus I am I decided to create my own. However, due to some extreme convergence of events (graduation, job interviews, other projects, life) I ended up doing all the programming (and much of the art) in less than a day. So it's super hacked up and gross looking, but I'll keep it around as a lesson to not procrastinate haha.
