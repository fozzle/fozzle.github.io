<p>Hi, I’m Kyle Petrovich.</p>

<p>I’m a computer science student at the Georgia Institute of Technology.</p>

<p>I like working on web apps, games, and bots.</p>

<p>In my spare time I enjoy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Volunteering at WREK Atlanta</li>
  <li>Working on bikes…and riding them, of course.</li>
  <li>Going to shows. My favorite venues are Wonderroot and The Goat Farm.</li>
  <li>Travelling to new places.</li>
  <li>Eating pizza. Oh so much pizza.</li>
</ul>
