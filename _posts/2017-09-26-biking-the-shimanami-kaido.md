## Introduction

A friend and I recently traveled to Japan for 20 days, starting in Tokyo and working all the way down to Yakushima. One of my favorite sections of the trip, as well as the inspiration for the trip in the first place, was biking the Shimanami Kaido. It wasn't very difficult to setup the journey, but in the interest of helping other English speakers who would want to do the same, here's a detailed account of how we did it.

## About the Shimanami Kaido

The Shimanami Kaido is an expressway built across the Seto Inland Sea spanning several islands via a multitude of impressive bridges. The real interesting part is that all these bridges have pedestrian and bike paths so the route has become a sort of "cyclists haven", offering both relaxing scenic rides or challenging climbs depending on the path you take. The scenery is nothing short of breathtaking and all routes are well marked by blue road stripes, making getting lost nearly impossible. The entirety of the route can be done in one day, or you can take your time and stay in one of the many lodgings available on the islands.

## Logistics

### Getting there

You can start your journey in either Imabari or Onomichi. We chose to start in Imabari, because we were already on Shikoku island,  but going the other way wouldn't have made a large practical difference. As always is the case with Japan, there are plenty of rail options to get to either city so use Google maps or [HyperDia](http://www.hyperdia.com/) to figure that part out for yourself.

### Physical Preparation

I am of the belief that almost anyone that can ride a bike should be able to at least do the "basic" Shimanami Kaido route on bike, without too much issue. It's 70km (~43 miles) in total, which is a lot, yes, but if you start early you shouldn't have a problem taking a leisurely pace. There are some climbs around the bridges but the bridges themselves and most of the recommended path is flat.

If you are interested in the "advanced" routes, they can be challenging, but with *determination* and *the power of friendship* I believe even novice cyclists could struggle through. Whether or not the struggle is enjoyable is up to personal interpretation ðŸ˜ˆ.

### Procuring Bikes

If you're like most people, you won't be traveling with your bike through Japan, so you will need to rent one. If you are a cycling enthusiast or plan on tackling some of the harder routes, I'd highly recommend getting your bike from the [Giant store](https://giant-store.jp/giant-store-rentcycle/en/index.html) in Imabari or Onomichi. Both stores are not far from the train stations, nor are they far from the start of the route itself. We rented the carbon road bikes which ended up being full carbon, Shimano 105 groupset bikes, far nicer than anything I've ever ridden before. They provide you with tire levers, a pump, lock, and spare tube within a frame bag, so you won't need to bring any of your own tools. Most importantly, though, they offer one way rentals, so you can start continue your travels without any backtracking. Please note that you **need to call ahead** in order to reserve a one way rental! We cheated and had a Japanese friend do it for us, but you will probably not have a problem if you try to do it in English, as it seemed most of the staff spoke English themselves or were used to English speaking tourists.

If the price tag on the Giant bikes is scaring you, don't feel as if you need to have such a nice bike in order to make the journey, almost any bike could tackle the recommended route so long as it fits you properly. Luckily there are other options in the form of [rental terminals](http://www.go-shimanami.jp/global/english/bicycle/) set up throughout the islands. We saw others using these bikes and passed a few of the terminals ourselves. The bikes seemed fine at a glance, but I can't provide any detailed info. Do take note of the hours as these are not multi-day/overnight rentals like at Giant.


### Dealing with Baggage

Finally, if this is only part of a larger trip, you'll probably have some luggage with you. Don't let that stop you from living your Shimanami Kaido dreams! You can ship your luggage with [Yamato Transport](http://www.kuronekoyamato.co.jp/en/tourist/hotel/) for a relatively small fee. It's a simple, fast, and ubiquitous service that you've probably seen throughout Japan already. Look for the black cat carrying a kitten, that's their logo (cute!). You can ask your concierge or host to arrange a shipment to your destination hotel and an agent will come by and pick up your bags within no time. Alternatively you can fill out the form yourself and drop it off at most convenience stores, but I recommend getting help as you want to make sure you've got everything in proper order when dealing with your stuff. It cost us ~3000 yen to ship 2 large travel backpacks, and we were able to specify a date so that our stuff would arrive when we did. Originally we were going to just bike with our packs on, and I cannot stress enough how *terrible* that would have been in hindsight. If you're doing a one way journey, ship your luggage. It's worth it!

## Our Ride

As stated before, we started in Imabari and ended in Onomichi, so this is from the perspective of travel in that direction only.

### Day 1 - Day of Death

We started off early as possible, not really knowing anything of the route. Our destination was Miyaura Port, a small town on Omishima Island, where we had a guesthouse reservation. I opted to as many of the side routes as I could. This turned out to be a great choice, though very difficult at times.

#### Intermediate Route - Oshimi Island

This segment was a very easy ride, overall. There are a few climbs but none that are extreme in grade. It is longer than the recommended route, however, at 15.2km. It runs along the coast of Oshima Island and you get to pass by a shipyard and see massive pieces of container ships being put together.

#### Advanced Route (Loop) - Hakatajima Island

Near the end of the Hakatajima island recommended route, there is a turn off for Hirakiyami Park. This is the "advanced route" on this island. It is a short loop that was probably the most grueling part of our trip, with extremely steep, seemingly unending climbs. At the top you are rewarded with some nice views at the park (and a bathroom), but overall I'd say skip this particular section unless you specifically want the challenge.

#### Advanced Route - Omishima Island

Upon reaching Omishima Island you will soon be presented with a fork in the road, to continue on the recommended route or to take the "advanced" "Island Explorer" route. We, of course, opted for the latter. It's a bit longer, at ~21km vs the ~14km it would take to use the "recommended" and "intermediate" routes to get there. If you have the time or are going to Miyaura, I would recommend this route wholeheartedly. It is undoubtedly challenging, with lots of steep climbs, but there are spectacular vistas, museums, and an onsen awaiting you.

Located on this path, you'll find a small coffee shop, seemingly in the middle of nowhere. We didn't catch the name but it's a very nice place to rest up for the coming journey.

If you're a fan of museums and sightseeing there are several on this route:

- Ken Iwata Mother and Child Museum
- Toyo Ito Museum of Architecture
- Tokoro Museum Omishima
- Hakata Engyo Corporation Omishima Factory (salt production factory tour...)
- Omishima Museum of Art

And you'll eventually end up at Miyaura Port!

### Day 1 (Night) - Miyaura Port

Ok so staying here is really the pro move, I think. The town itself is very small, but nice. There are a few restaurants but make sure to eat early as things don't stay open too late here.

The real reward is the onsen. Which is now like my \#1 most desired thing to see after a strenuous bike ride. The Mare GraCia Omishima onsen is located by the coast, and it costs ~500yen to bathe there. As with most onsens, make sure to bring your own towel and soap unless you want to rent/buy one on premises. The spa's feature is the saltwater bath which supposedly has healing properties but the thing that was most appreciated by me was the outdoor bath overlooking the coast. As it's facing West it makes for a perfect way to enjoy the sunset and end your day.

Also the town has quite a few shrines and temples, if that's your thing.

### Day 2 - Easy Rider

After waking early from a night's rest, we set off for Onomichi. Determined to make this day easier than the last, we opted to choose the recommended routes whenever possible.

#### Intermediate Route - Omishima Island

A short route to get from one side of Omishima Island to the other. There is maybe one climb of note but it isn't particularly hard. This route isn't particularly memorable either so I'm not sure what to put here.

#### Recommended Route - Ikuchijima Island

#### End

Finally, the journey ended at a ferry terminal. This is because the bridge to Onomichi is not suitable for bikes. For a small fee (Â¥110 at time of writing) you can board with your bike and within minutes you'll be in Onomichi, only a few minutes ride from the train station.

## Addendum - Onomichi

I just wanted to plug the city of Onomichi as being a generally awesome place to visit. It has so much history to explore and the part of town on the mountain that predated cars is a wonderful labyrinth to get yourself lost in. Every corner you turn reveals a something interesting, giving you that feeling of discovery over and over and over again. There's a real hip, young, and artsy vibe to the entire city. Many of the buildings had been abandoned, and now groups have formed to swoop in and renovate them into galleries, cafes, and guesthouses that you can visit.

There's also stray cats *everywhere*, it's super cute.
