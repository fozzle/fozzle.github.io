<p>This semester I've been taking a mobile apps class (CS-4261-A, CS-8803-MAS), which has been completely awesome. Well, lectures aside, which are mostly guest lectures...but other than that the class is completely project based and I love that because it means I get to actually make stuff!</p>

<p>The class has a bit of an entrepreneurial tinge. You have to come up with an idea, business plan, pitch video...it's almost like we're making our own little company. After much goading from me, my group is making a mobile gardening app called <em>Plantr</em> (I'm involved in the community garden here at Tech so I was pretty passionate about this idea haha). <em>Plantr</em> intends to combine real time data from embedded sensors to provide alerts and recommendations for community gardens. We're entering the final stages of our "beta" release, and we have a nifty pitch video courtesy of my group mate Casey Mann. Check it out!</p>
