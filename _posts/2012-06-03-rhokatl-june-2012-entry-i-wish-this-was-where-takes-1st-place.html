<p>So I attended RHOK Atlanta this weekend (in fact, writing this there now!), my first hack-a-thon in...oh about 2 years. Also, the first hack-a-thon where I felt I could actually <strong>contribute</strong> and be useful. I think I just bummed free food last time...</p>

<p>Our entry was <a title="I Wish this Was Where?" href="http://iwishthiswaswhere.herokuapp.com">I Wish This Was, Where? </a>, an idea piggybacking on artist Candy Chang's <a title="I Wish This Was" href="http://iwishthiswas.cc">I Wish This Was</a> public art project that invites residents to provide civic input on-site. Surprisingly, it won first place. With so many fantastic applications presented we were all shocked!</p>

<p>I worked in conjuction with Jeff Walters, David Emory and Mathilde Piard. David gave us the design, Jeff created a prototype mobile app, and Mathilde was the one bringing the ideas and contacting the people in charge of the project. I was in charge of making the website backend, maps frontend, and deployment.</p>

<p>The way it works is that every hour or so the site crawls Instagram and Flickr, looking for images with the tag #Iwishthiswas. If they're new and geotagged, they're added to the database. When a user visits the site, it centers on their location and displays tags in the area. If they click on tags they are presented with a thumbnail and description.</p>

<p>Future ideas for the site include being able to comment and upvote project ideas, possibly links to related Kickstarters, etc.</p>

<p>All in all an extremely simple but effective little site. I got to learn Heroku which was super cool (and frustrating, at times), met some really great people, and had a lot of fun.</p>
