<p>If you ever need to redirect an entire website to one location, you can either use mod_rewrite or this handy little line.</p>

<pre>RedirectMatch 301 ^/ http://rainicorns.com</pre>

<p>Just put this in a .htaccess file at the root level of your directory. All traffic will redirect to this single URL. Can be useful if you aren't interested in redirecting old locations to their new equivalents, and don't want your users to experience a bunch of 404s from old links.</p>

<p>Just note that if you want specific locations preserved. (http://dogbreathbiscuits.com/doglisting/ to go to http://rainicorns.com/doglisting/) you'll want a normal 301 redirect instead.</p>

<pre>Redirect 301 / http://rainicorns.com</pre>
