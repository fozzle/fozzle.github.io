Did some very very shallow dabbling with the Play web framework today. Working through the introductory tutorial, here are some differences and similarities I found with web frameworks I've used in the past (Rails, Django).
<h3>Similarities</h3>
I felt pretty comfortable navigating the Play application architecture. It's about the same as any other MVC framework. You have your models in a models package, controllers in a controllers package,  and views in a views package and they all work mostly like you'd expect. Then you have the conf directory where you have your application settings, routing, and migrations (or "evolutions" as Play calls them). Making routes is about as easy as it is in Rails with a simple <em>METHOD PATTERN ACTION </em>syntax. When running a server, changes to files will be picked up and compiled so you don't need to keep restarting.
<h3>Differences</h3>
Models in Play are a little weird to me. You define the structure of the model with a case class...but then you have to define a companion object for all the retrieval methods. I'm pampered by using the Django ORM and ActiveRecord, so having to write SQL again to retrieve all objects is funky. I'm willing to bet someone has automated this in some way already, it seems a little ridiculous to write some of this boilerplate.

In the views, you have to declare the types of the values you are passing in...which makes sense because Scala is strongly typed and all.

Migrations are written using SQL.
