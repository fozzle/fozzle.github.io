<p>I made a <a href="http://twitter.com/horse_ebooks">horse_ebooks</a>-ripoff bot as a joke for my friend, who is taking a Moby Dick course this semester (Yea, an entire course dedicated to this one book...that surprised me).</p>

<p>It's a short little thing that navigates to a random place in the text ocean that is Moby Dick, snags the entire next line, chops off what it thinks is a sentence, and tweets it. Sometimes mildly amusing, most of the time just trash. I think it'd be funnier if I chopped up the lines even more...but as a bot that took less than ten minutes, I'm happy.</p>

<p>I swear, horse_ebooks <emp>has</emp> to have someone behind it. It's consistently too funny.</p>

<p>Anyways, <a href="http://twitter.com/whale_ebooks">thar she blows</a>.</p>
