<p>I have made a little bit of progress on Gravitix.</p>

<p>Added some gravity inversion, spikes, level changes. MelonJS and Tiled are great, can't recommend enough. It's nice to be able to dabble with something so quickly. It's got a LONG way to go, along with some serious tuning, but if you want to check out what it looks like head <a title="Gravitix" href="http://static.kpetrovich.com/gravitix">here</a>.</p>

<p>Schools been bearing down pretty hard, thus why I haven't gotten to far with it. My buddy who originally made this may be trying his hand at art assets, so maybe it won't look so silly next time. Thinking about taking it in a new direction gameplay wise, maybe with more realistic physics. Like if you fall from a tall height, you will bounce farther, etc. We'll see, just some ideas bouncing around in my head. Ha, bouncing. Get it? Ok I'm done.</p>
