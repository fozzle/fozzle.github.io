<p>Oh man, it's actually happening. We've got our passports ready, car tuned up, peace offerings purchased (6 pack of Laughing Skull amber ale). We are going to Canada! Got to make good on all the talk I've done about this trip, ha.</p>

Our itinerary for now:
<ul>
	<li>3/17/12 - Wake up 4:30AM for a 5:00AM departure. Drive 16 hours to Toronto, Canada. Learning how to drive manual on the way.</li>
	<li>3/18/12 - Arrive at destination at 12-2 AM. Destination? Some guys apartment in downtown Toronto. We used Couchsurfer to reach out to some interesting people, one got back to us and we'll be arriving amidst some crazy art party. Sounds good to me! (If I don't pass out from exhaustion first).</li>
	<li>3/19/12 - Probably gonna check out Niagra Falls (obligatory), tool around Toronto. Gonna climb some rooftops with another Couchsurfer to get some sweet shots.</li>
	<li>3/20/12 - Science museum! CN Tower! More Toronto! Whatever is recommended by our host!</li>
	<li>3/21/12 - Going to drive out to <a title="Algonquin Park" href="http://www.algonquinpark.on.ca/">Algonquin Park</a> or <a title="Killarney Park" href="http://www.ontarioparks.com/english/kill.html">Killarney Park</a> for a smidgen of camping and astrophotography.</li>
	<li>3/22/12 - Probably going to start driving back as soon as possible, depending on our physical or mental state.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'll be keeping this blog updated with photos and interesting observations. For now though, gonna get what little sleep I can.</p>
