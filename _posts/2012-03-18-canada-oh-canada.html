<p>Today was exhausting. I want to write this all down though. Especially as an outlet for expression because right now I can't even talk!</p>

<p>Arriving at the biggest and most intricate house party I've ever seen, we were denied sleep for quite some time. Not complaining though. There were people crammed in every nook and cranny, the living room was painted over and decorated as an underwater scene, and people were already pretty drunk (and coincidentally talkative and friendly). I got to make friends (and hopefully no enemies!) with some locals,  and get my boogie on in the "Tsunami Room". We probably didn't crash until 3-4AM, but it was worth it!</p>

<p>We set out at an early 10AM from our host's place, without any plan of action. "What do you want to do?" I asked my friend. "I don't know, let's just walk down this street." was the reply. So we walked down <a title="Yonge Street: Wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yonge_Street">Yonge</a> (which is one of the longest streets in the world and also functions as a sort of "Main Street" of Ontario). Ended up getting some traditional Canadian Chipotle...and decided to bounce over to the CN Tower.</p>

<p>30 loons later we were up on the observation deck, towering over Toronto. It was pretty cool. The elevator ride has a window so you can see yourself elevate up 100+ stories. Also neat is the glass floor, which can be kind of freaky at first. To the horror of my friend (and probably those around me), I was jumping up and down on the glass to test it's strength. Hah.</p>

<p>We then ended up walking through <a title="Chinatown, Toronto: Wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatown,_Toronto">Chinatown</a>/<a title="Kensington Market: Wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_Market">Kensington Market</a> (on accident), which was really cool. At first, I was like "oh shit we are not in a good place", but I grew accustomed to it, and looking back it wasn't <em>that</em> sketchy. It kind of reminds me of Little Five points in Atlanta, it's old, there's a lot of bizarre shops, street bums, and young people.  It seems to be the place to go for good food (or so the crowded cafe's and restaurants signaled to us). We'll probably be returning tomorrow.</p>

<p>Then we headed through University of Toronto to check out university life in Canada. It's an interesting campus, with some really old buildings coupled with some modern. Doesn't seem to be any running architectural motif, and it's fairly urban feeling, despite being it's own distinct entity. I think I prefer Tech's campus, personally. What was really cool though was visiting their<a title="University of Toronto Libraries: Wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Toronto_Libraries"> library</a>, which is the third largest in North America. It was so big! The building was really funky looking. Inside it was really nice, like if Tech's re-done bottom floors were propagated over 5 more stories.  Actually, probably nicer.</p>

<p>Bounced over to Queen's Park to do some people watching, and now we're chilling at the Starbucks. Saw a shoplifter get tackled in the street. That was a bizarre thing to oversee, with no context. Just looked out the window and some guy is getting manhandled by another civilian (who was security), while all the people on Yonge just watch, confused as we were.</p>

<p>I hope my voice returns tomorrow. I don't think people can take anymore of my bad handwriting. Probably going to visit the Science Center, climb some rooftops, and...more Starbucks sitting. Yes, I am addicted to the Internet...and Tech left me with some nuggets of work to accomplish.</p>
