<p>So every time I reinstall Windows 7 on my laptop, I have this horrible sound popping/crackle/static when I use the official drivers for my model. Even though I've ran through this about four times now, I always manage to forget the solution. No more! And if you are suffering from the same problem, then hopefully this will help you too.</p>

<p>After poring through forums, I came across this "beta" driver posted by a fellow over at<em> 7 Forums. </em>Greedily I downloaded and Â installed it...and now I have it! Pure, crisp, un-tarnished sound. Beautiful.</p>

<p>Here are my specs, if you share the same model and are having this issue, this post is for you.</p>

<code>Asus F50SF
Windows 7 x64
4Gb Ram
Nvidia 220M
Core 2 Duo 2.53Ghz

<p>I am not responsible for anything this may or may not do to your system, but if you are like me, you past the point of caring about that.</p>
