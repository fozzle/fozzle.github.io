<p>I saw on hacker news today that ScribD created a little <a title="botrace" href="http://www.scribd.com/jobs/botrace">coding game </a>where you pit a bot against others, racing to collect the most fruit in the most categories. Too fun to pass up!</p>

<p><a href="http://kpetrovich.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/humblehodor.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-155" title="humblehodor" src="http://kpetrovich.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/humblehodor-300x192.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="192" /></a></p>

<p>I had a good time creatingÂ <a title="humble hodor" href="http://www.scribd.com/jobs/botrace_bot/215">Humble Hodor</a>, though I didn't get quite as fancy as some of the competitors, my bots seem solid. Humble Hodor won his first 5 matches, which is neat. May he continue to mercilessly pillage all the fruit ScribD has to offer!</p>

<p>EDIT: Now my bot is getting trashed. Back to the drawing board!</p>
