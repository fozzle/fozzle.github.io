<p>It's been a while since I've made a post, but I have a good reason. It's because I'm currently on exchange in Hong Kong at the <a title="HKUST" href="http://ust.hk">Hong Kong University of Science and Technology</a>, and busier than ever! Hong Kong has been a fantastic experience thus far. I've met a ton of new people, tried plenty of new food, and have been exploring the region as much as possible.</p>

<p> I could go on but I think you get the idea: I'm having a blast.</p>

<p>Between classes, sightseeing, and sleep, I'm plinking away at <a title="Wrektranet 2.0" href="http://github.com/wrekatlanta/wrektranet">Wrektranet 2.0</a> along with my buddy <a href="http://patrickstoica.com">Patrick Stoica</a>. It's a new web application intended to replace the spaghetti-code, patch-work intranet (wrektranet!)  for our beloved college radio station <a title="WREK" href="http://wrek.org">WREK</a>. We inherited the project from Highgroove Studios, who gave us a large platform to start with (thanks guys!). We're hoping to be able to replace all the general management functions, and time willing we may even look into upsurping Audiovault, our automation program. Hey, we can dream, right?</p>

<p>This marks my first foray into Ruby/RoR development, and I have so much to learn. Luckily there are similarities between Django and RoR which has made the learning a lot quicker. Here are my first impressions.</p>

<p><strong>(Warning shallow opinions below)</strong></p>

I like:
<ul>
	<li>Migrations built in (no need for South)</li>
	<li>Large gem ecosystem</li>
	<li>Creating basic CRUD functionality for models is brainless</li>
	<li>Rake!</li>
</ul>
<div>I don't like:</div>
<div>
<ul>
	<li>Too much "magic" for my taste. I actually enjoy Django's verbosity. Even the imports.</li>
	<li>Ruby's <em>TMTOWTDI </em>(There's more than one way to do it...) philosophy seems to just unnecessarily complicate things, but to be fair, this is coming from a guy who's been using Python for the last 2 years. Of course we are using a style guide, but even still, <em>why?</em></li>
</ul>
<div>Hopefully I can make some sizable contributions even while I'm here.</div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>That's all for my little "life update". Have to resuscitate the blog every once in a while, you know!</div>
PS: No-one really uses "lei hao" in Hong Kong they just say "hello", but that wouldn't be as fun of a title, so yea.
