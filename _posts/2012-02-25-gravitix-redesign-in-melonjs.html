<p>I've been dabbling in game design recently. I've been working with C#/XNA to make a very basic platformer, just to learn the basics. I quickly realized that building a game engine from the ground up (or in this case, off a framework) was a bigger task than previously anticipated. With school, work, and other projects competing for time, I put it on the shelf.</p>

<p>Then, I stumbled upon the HTML5 game engine, <a href="http://melonjs.org">MelonJS</a>, the other day. I was pretty blown away by how easy it was to use. It integrates closely with <a href="http://www.mapeditor.org/">Tiled</a>, provides basic object entities, and a lot of other game-specific boilerplate. Not to mention, it's HTML5. That's hip, right?</p>

<p>I'm starting anew with the intent to resurrect a game a friend and I worked on back in middle school. When we were kids, we made all kinds of half-finished games using the drag-n-drop program GameMaker. We have the abandoned childhood websites to prove it!</p>

<p><em>These should be good for a laugh. About the design...well...I plead innocence. I was 12.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.freewebs.com/biohazardgamestudios/">Biohazard Game Studios</a> - Our "companies" website. Notice under "games", none have been completed yet. I guess some things never change...until now!</p>
<p><a href="http://rscarbhg.webs.com/">RscarBHG</a> - My mate's personal website. He kept toying around with GameMaker long after most of us stopped. He is actually the true creator of Gravitix.</p>

<p><em>Note: You'll probably not be able to run any of these games unless you have WindowsXP or virtualize WindowsXP.</em></p>

<p>Anyways, now that you've had a laugh at my childhood design sensibilities, more about Gravitix:</p>

<p>You're basically a bouncing ball, and there are gravity changes, spikes, falling platforms, you know...the normal platform stuff. You just get through to the end of the level. It's a the most basic of basic, but even to this day I find it somewhat entertaining. I figured revisiting it with a sharpened skillset and a little more sense for good gameplay, this would be a fun project.</p>

<p>You can <a href="http://static.kpetrovich.com/gravitix/">track it's progress</a>, if you'd like. I'll try to upload after every major chunk is completed.</p>
