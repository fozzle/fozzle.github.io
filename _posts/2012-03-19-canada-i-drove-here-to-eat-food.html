This title has summed up how I felt about today's Toronto adventure.

We woke up pretty late and got some breakfast at KOS in Kensington Market. Absolutely fantastic breakfast, and cheap!

We then took some time to further explore Kensington Market, because we mostly just skimmed through yesterday. It's a really neat place, I still feel like we could get more out of it. It's a good thing I can't get cash over here (ATMs don't accept my card, but I can still use the card for transactions...merp.), or else I'd have spent a fortune on cheap crap there. After tiring of Kensington, we walked around aimlessly some more, ate some more, people watched, ate more, walked aimlessly, ate more...you get the picture.

I told my friend "Yea, I guess we just came to Canada to eat...and to eat the same stuff we could eat at home." Ha. Even though that statement was pretty spot on regarding today, it was still fun. Just being somewhere new is a good change of pace.

We actually <em>do</em> have some plans tomorrow. Turns out the <a title="ROM: Wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Ontario_Museum">Royal Ontario Museum</a> is free for students on Tuesdays (hell yea), and we're going to hit up the <a title="Distillery District: Wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distillery_District">Distillery District</a>, because supposedly that's a pretty swanky place.
