<p>Today was a great way to wrap up our journey to Toronto.</p>

<p>We started off going to the Royal Ontario Museum, which was <em>awesome</em>. Unfortunately we couldn't get in for free. We handed our Georgia Tech student IDs with a big grin, and the lady at the counter said "It's only free for <em>Canadian</em> students...". Well, crap. We put down 13 bones and went anyways though. It was so big! So many great things to see, with pieces from ancient civilizations all over the world, all kinds of animals in suspended animation, and some sweet dinosaur exhibits (Wow, sauropods are <em>massive!)</em>. It was really tiring though, near the end of the 2+ hours we were in there, I was ready to get the hell out.</p>

<p>We exited, hungry and in search of sustenance. Our hosts told us the food trucks by the city hall had some mean <a title="Poutine: Wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poutine">poutine</a>. It was indeed delicious, though after finishing mine and some of my friends...I think I shortened my life by a few days. Ha.</p>

<p>We ambled over to the Distillery District...which was cool, aesthetically, but kind of boring overall. Meh. At least I can say we did it. I liked the art that was dispersed around there, it was creepy...in a good way.</p>

<p>I think we're going out for drinks with our host, if he gets his paper done in time. I'm going to miss this place, and all the people I've met here. Hopefully I'll see them again someday. <a title="Couchsurfing" href="http://couchsurfing.org">Couchsurfing</a> is really the way to go if you're an adventurous traveler. The experiences you gain by living in "another's shoes" or rather "another's couch" is truly irreplaceable.</p>
