<p>After working out how the Hadoop WebHDFS endpoints worked, it was time to hook it up to Wso2 API Manager, an API gateway we will be using for access control and authentication. Hit some snags right out of the gate, because Hadoop relies on redirects for it's file operations, and API Manager doesn't seem to like redirects, returning a "Resource not found" instead of following them.</p>

<p>Again, the basic Hadoop flow is, you query the name node for a file (or to create it), and you're returned a redirect to a datanode which actually has the file. Then you query that datanode and it'll get coughed up (or created). We're going to have to work out a way to get API manager to follow those redirects instead of backing out if we want to use it.</p>
