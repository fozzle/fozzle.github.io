<p>I saw these neat Atari cartridge clocks on <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/GrandWazoo?section_id=8043827">Etsy</a> the other day. I wanted one, but they were kind of steep at twenty two bucks a pop.</p>

<p>No matter, I figured, I could make it myself. It was really easy and only took around thirty minutes.</p>

You'll need the following tools and supplies:
<ul>
	<li>Atari Cartridge - You can find these at thrift stores or flea markets for a dollar. Try and get one with the art intact, it'll look better.</li>
	<li>Clock Movement - I just used some generic one I found on Amazon. Get one that is thin enough to fit within the cartridge, I think it looks a lot better that way. For reference, the Atari cartridge is about 97mm x 81mm x 20mm.</li>
	<li>Hot Glue Gun - You may actually not need this, because the fit can be so tight as to secure the clock by force alone, but just in case.</li>
	<li>(Optional, but nice!) Rotary Tool - You can scrape out the soft plastic yourself, but it will be 10x easier with a decent rotary tool. Also, it will look a lot cleaner that way.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Step 1: Opening the Cartridge</strong>

<p>Opening the Atari Cartridge is easy. There's a screw you're going to have to remove that keeps the cartridge together. You can feel for it with your hands and then insert a phillips head screwdriver and take it out. Otherwise, if you're interested in keeping the label pristine, use a hair dryer to remove the label, then attack the screw.</p>

<p>With the screw removed, simply pry the two halves apart. Take your time, squeezing the front while trying to separate them. Don't worry about breaking it so much though, they are durable and you'll have to use <em>some </em>force to get them apart.</p>

<p>Next remove the actual chip, along with the spring and the door. We're ready to grind out the insides.</p>

<strong>Step 2: Preparing the Insides</strong>

Now that you have your cart open, whip out your rotary tool (or some pliers failing that). You'll want to grind down (or pull out, with pliers) all the plastic inside except for the shell of the case itself. This is necessary to fit the movement inside, as it just barely fits. Once you've grinded everything out, it should look like this.
